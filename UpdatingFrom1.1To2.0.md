To update to 2.0 you will need to make sure your version of node js is lts 18 and not 20

The other changes you will need to make is put all the variables you set at the top of the file into the config file below each variable name ex  


>$yourJarFileName     
>EMPTYLINE

will be changed to 


>$yourJarFileName \
>Server-Null.jar
