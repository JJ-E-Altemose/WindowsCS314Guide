Still have not fixed file path with space issue


SPRINT 4 INFO

I am still figuring out how to set up the SQL, and then I will either figure out how to do that with Powershell or add a separate guide to set that up. If you are able to use docker with your system even if temporarly that might be best if you need help setting that up contact me on teams.
